A react implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 

Built with CRA, and I can never remember if you need to yarn install or npm install to set it up. Try both. If one doesn't work, delete corresponding .lock file and try with the other. I think it's yarn install though. Since I have a yarn.lock locally. 

Starting with a naive render of individual block components to represent a simplistic model. Looking to migrate over to using html5's canvas after basic logic-checks are passing.
